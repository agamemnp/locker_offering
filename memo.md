# Pilot Proposal: Athens Hub Injection to Athens Lockers

## 1. Overview
Based on the provided pricing structures and service components, we invite you to join our pilot project, where parcels will be routed from our Athens hub directly to Athens lockers. This initiative is designed to validate the operational efficiency and technical integration of our locker-based delivery system, ensuring both cost-effectiveness and a seamless customer experience. In Greece’s fiercely competitive courier industry—where the race to the bottom is a constant challenge—we recognize that optimizing expensive last-mile operations in key markets like Athens and Thessaloniki is critical. That’s why we are opening our extensive Locker network for your use, paving the way for a collaborative, innovative, and sustainable solution that sets a new industry benchmark.

## 3. Pilot Proposal Details

### Service Flow

- **Hub Injection to Locker Delivery:**  
  The pilot will implement a service flow where parcels are routed from the Athens hub through a hub injection process to designated Athens lockers. Both the standard and express locker services (SLC and ELC) will be available to cater to different delivery urgency levels.

- **Pricing Application:**  
  - **Locker Delivery:**  
    - **Standard Service (SLC):** Priced at €0.90, with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of **1–5 days** from dispatch and a **guaranteed 1-day** delivery after pickup from the warehouse.  
    - **Express Service (ELC):** Priced at €1.80 with a 1-day SLA.
  - **Additional Charges:**  
    - Pickup costs, network costs, and locker slot size charges are applied as per the relevant tables.
  - **Discounts:**  
    - A 40% discount is applied on both the LHWC component (for hub injection) and the LHWH component (for Athens-to-Athens local hub deliveries).

---

## 4. Technical Issues

- **API Requirements:**  
  - The API must capture either a **Locker ID** or a complete **address string** when initiating a delivery request.
  - It should include an option to specify whether the delivery service is **express** or **standard**.

- **Barcode and Voucher Specifications:**  
  - Further discussion is required on the specifics regarding the **barcode number** and **voucher specifications**.
  - The customer’s voucher will serve as a unique identifier for tracking purposes.

- **Tracking & Integration:**  
  - Real-time tracking will be facilitated via API calls and web hook notifications.
  - Current locker availability and an interactive locker map can be accessed via the provided link.

Technical implementations for the integration are detailed in the REST API documentation available at:  
[https://sp.skroutzlastmile.gr/restapidoc.html](https://sp.skroutzlastmile.gr/restapidoc.html)

**Summary of Contents:**  
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers to integrate with the last mile delivery service. It covers:
- **Endpoints:** Details on API endpoints for order creation, tracking, and status updates.
- **Authentication:** Instructions on the authentication mechanism required to access the API.
- **Request Parameters:** A breakdown of required parameters for API calls.
- **Response Formats:** Sample responses and error handling to aid in development.
- **Usage Guidelines:** Best practices and code examples for seamless integration.
---

## 5. Invoicing and Pricing Calculation

- **Monthly Invoicing:**  
  - Invoices will be generated at the end of each month, covering all usage to date.
  
- **Post-Factum Pricing Calculation:**  
  - Final pricing will be calculated after a comprehensive review of the monthly usage data.
  - Detailed invoices with a breakdown of charges will be available through the designated link.

---

## 6. Next Steps

- **Technical Discussion:**  
  - Schedule a meeting to discuss API requirements, particularly regarding locker IDs/address strings, barcode numbers, and voucher specifications.
  
- **Pilot Setup:**  
  - Finalize the operational framework and logistics for the Athens hub injection to Athens lockers.
  - Provide stakeholders with access to the locker availability map and API documentation.

- **Monitoring & Reporting:**  
  - Implement real-time tracking via API and web hooks.
  - Prepare monthly usage reports to ensure transparent invoicing and ongoing process improvements.

---

## 7. Example Pricing Calculation (Using Offered Components)

For illustration, the following example pricing calculation combines the LHWH, SLC, and LSC components:

- **Local Hub-to-Hub Delivery (LHWH):**  
  - For an Athens-to-Athens route (e.g., from Zone_0 to Zone_0), the standard cost is **€0.45** (from Table 2).  
  - **Discount Application:** With a 40% discount, the cost becomes:  
    \[
    €0.45 \times 0.60 = €0.27
    \]

- **Locker Standard Service (SLC):**  
  - Base Price: **€0.90**

- **Locker Slot Size Charge (LSC):**  
  - Assuming a medium slot is used: **€0.20**

- **Total Price Calculation:**  
  \[
  LHWH + SLC + LSC = €0.27 + €0.90 + €0.20 = €1.37
  \]

Thus, the combined cost for a delivery using LHWH, SLC, and LSC is **€1.37**.

---


## 9. Dynamic Locker Pricing (DLC) Option (future work..)

SLC could also be offered as DLC (Dynamic Locker Pricing). In this option, we can set a dynamic price range from (example: **€0.60 to €1.40**). Our API will outline the locker slots available at the specified price and automatically reject orders that exceed the upper limit set, ensuring that only the desired pricing options are offered.

---

## 10. Additional Caveats

- **Locker Stay Duration:**  
  Lockers are available for a 48-hour period. Any prolongation beyond 48 hours incurs an extra charge of €0.20 per day.
  
- **Return to Sender:**  
  If an order is returned to the sender, an additional cost of €0.50 applies.
  
- **Locker Attempt Policy:**  
  Locker products include one single delivery attempt. If the product fails to fit in the locker, the order will roll down to standard home delivery pricing.
  
- **Service Discretion:** **The assignment of a specific locker or latitude/longitude location is at SLM's discretion. Our API reserves the right to reject orders for any reason deemed prudent by SLM.**
